🧠 Sudoku Sage Tutorial
Welcome to the Advanced Sudoku Sage! This guide explains the different input modes and features to help you tackle even the toughest puzzles.
1. Input Modes (The Mode Button)
The core feature of this game is the ability to easily switch between different ways of entering numbers. Use the main Mode Button (below the number pad) to cycle through the four states:

Purpose
Input Action
Value Mode
✏️
Enter final answers.
Inputting a number replaces any existing notes or values.
Corner Note Mode
✍️
Enter small, corner pencil marks.
Ideal for candidates you want to track in a cell.
Center Mark Mode
⭐
Enter bold, center candidates.
Useful for marking pairs/triples or high-priority candidates.
Strike Mode
🚫
Manually delete notes/candidates.
Use this to actively eliminate a candidate from a cell's corner or center notes.

2. Cell Selection and Input
Single & Multi-Selection
Single Select: Tap or click a cell.
Multi-Select: Hold down the Shift, Ctrl, or Cmd key while clicking multiple cells.
Note: On touch devices, multi-selection is not supported.
Applying Input
Select one or more target cells.
Tap a number on the number pad (1-9).
The input (Value, Corner Note, Center Mark, or Deletion) will be applied to all selected cells simultaneously, saving you time!
Erasing Content
Tap the ❌ Erase button to clear the value and all notes from any currently selected cell(s).
3. Visual Aids and Game Features
Number Highlighting
If you don't have any cells selected:
Tap a number (1-9): This will activate the Highlight Mode for that number.
Cells containing that number will be highlighted.
Cells containing that number as a corner or center note will also be highlighted.
The corresponding button on the number pad will turn Orange.
Crucially, valid placement cells (where that number can safely be placed) will be highlighted in light green.
Tap the number again: This will turn off the highlight.
Auto Notes
Tap the 📝 Auto Notes button to automatically scan the entire board and fill in the Corner Notes for every possible candidate in every empty, user-editable cell. This is a great way to start your candidate tracking!
