Advanced Sudoku: A Professional's Guide to Pure Logic Solving

This document serves as the official guide for the Advanced Sudoku application, focusing on leveraging the powerful input tools to facilitate efficient, logic-based puzzle solving. This program is designed for solvers who prefer a distraction-free experience and demand reliance on core deduction techniques.

1. Game Fundamentals and Rules

The foundation of Sudoku remains constant: the 9x9 grid must be filled with digits 1 through 9 such that:

Every Row contains each digit exactly once.

Every Column contains each digit exactly once.

Every 3x3 Box contains each digit exactly once.

Your goal is to complete the board using elimination and deduction without any trial-and-error (guessing).

2. The Logic Toolkit: Input Modes

Effective solving hinges on diligently tracking possibilities. The application provides four distinct input modes, allowing you to manage candidate notes and final answers seamlessly. Use the Mode Button to cycle between these states.

Mode

Icon

Function

Usage

Value Mode

✏️

Enters the confirmed, final solution into the cell.

Use only when the digit is proven correct by logic. This action automatically clears all notes in the cell.

Corner Note Mode

✍️

Enters small candidate numbers in the cell corners.

The primary mode for tracking all possible candidates for a cell. Ideal for identifying Singles and Pairs.

Center Mark Mode

⭐

Enters larger, central candidate marks.

Use this for advanced tracking. A common use is to highlight strong candidates across a box or to use specific advanced solving notations (like coloring).

Strike Mode

🚫

Removes an existing note (Corner or Center Mark).

Essential for elimination. Once a candidate is logically impossible for a cell, use this mode to remove it immediately.

3. Game Management and Efficiency Controls

The following controls enable rapid interaction with the board, critical for maintaining speed during complex solves.

Function

Note

Undo

↩️

Reverts the last input action (value, note, or clear).

Provides immediate correction for mistakes without resetting progress.

Erase

❌

Clears the value and all associated notes from the selected cells.

A fast way to empty cells if you need to re-evaluate an area.

Reset

🏠

Restores the board to its initial starting configuration.

Use this to begin a puzzle anew, preserving the original challenge.

Auto Notes

📝

Scans the entire board and automatically fills all empty cells with their initial, mathematically possible Corner Notes.

This is the most powerful efficiency tool, eliminating tedious manual entry of initial candidates.

4. Commitment to Pure Logic

In this advanced program, the Smart Hint and Solve features have been deliberately omitted. This decision enforces a reliance on human deduction, promoting skill development and ensuring the intellectual integrity of the solve.

No Hints: The application will not provide the next logical step. Every breakthrough must come from your own analysis of the grid.

No Instant Solve: The satisfaction of solving the puzzle completely relies on your persistence.

5. Core Solving Techniques

Successful solving begins with consistent application of these two fundamental techniques:

A. Scanning (The Full House Check)

Systematically scan the grid for opportunities to place digits based on existing numbers (givens and solved cells).

Blockage Analysis: Select a digit (1-9) to highlight all its current placements.

Candidate Box Check: For any 3x3 box, observe the rows and columns intersecting it. If a digit is already present in two of the three "lanes" (rows/columns) that cross the box, the digit must fall into the remaining open cell within that box.

B. Naked Singles (The Primary Note Taker Goal)

This is the most common and foundational deduction technique, heavily relying on your Corner Notes (✍️).

Perform Auto Notes: Begin the solve by using the Auto Notes (📝) feature.

Identify the Single: Scan all cells. If a cell contains only one candidate remaining in its Corner Notes, it is a Naked Single.

Execute: Enter this single candidate using the ✏️ Value Mode.

Propagate Elimination: Crucially, once a Naked Single is placed, immediately use Strike Mode (🚫) to eliminate that digit from the notes of every other cell in its row, column, and box. This elimination process is what reveals the next set of Naked Singles.

Mastering efficient note management and the subsequent elimination process is the key to conquering advanced puzzles.
